There are 6 independent directories:

- `cap_set` contains functions discovered by FunSearch that construct large cap
sets, and we also provide those cap sets in a numerical format for convenience.

- `admissible_set` contains functions discovered by FunSearch that construct
large admissible sets, and we also provide those admissible sets in a numerical
format for convenience.

- `bin_packing` contains heuristics discovered by FunSearch for online 1D bin
packing problems, and an evaluation suite to reproduce the results reported in
the paper.

- `cyclic_graphs` contains functions discovered by FunSearch that construct
large independent sets in strong products of cyclic graphs, and we also provide
those sets in a numerical format for convenience.

- `corner_free_sets` contains the discovered sets of indices, in numerical
format, satisfying the combinatorial degeneration constraints described for the
corners-free problem in the Supplementary Information.

- `implementation` contains an implementation of the evolutionary algorithm,
code manipulation routines, and a single-threaded implementation of the
FunSearch pipeline. It does not contain language models for generating new
programs, the sandbox for executing untrusted code, nor the infrastructure for
running FunSearch on our distributed system. This directory is intended to be
useful for understanding the details of our method, and for adapting it for use
with any available language models, sandboxes, and distributed systems.
